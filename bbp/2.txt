    Often we are given code that has lived in someone's home directory or
    repository for a long time.  Integrating this code into a library then
    involves guiding them through the process of making their intentions
    clear.

    Please perform a review on the code in two.py.

    Put your comments inline, starting with '##'.  An example comment is right
    after the docstring.

    Please save the file as two_code_review.py with your comments

    Please do not change the code.

    Note: Completely understanding it is *not* required (that would be in a later pass)
