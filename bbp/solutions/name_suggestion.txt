Actually, there seems to be more than one relevant delimiter.
First, I am assuming that the four sections of the file name (dend, axon, Scale and Clone)
are optional. 

Second, I would choose a unique delimiter to separate data between sections. Right now, it seems to 
be the role of '-', but this character can also be present on identifiers, for instance this
'dend' identifier C270999B-P2. 

Let's choose a unique identtifier that should never be part of dendrites or axons identifiers. 
And then let's surround the different relevant data with it. For instance, assuming '#' is valid, this:

    dend-C180298A-P2_axon-C190898A-P2_-_Scale_x1.000_y1.025_z1.000_-_Clone_11

would become: 
    dend#C180298A-P2_#axon-C190898A-P2_#_Scale_x1.000_y1.025_z1.000_#_Clone_11

Third, there seems to be characters that are not used. For instance, the '_' before the 'Scale' part 
and after the 'axon' part in the previous file name: 'right_#_Scale_'.
In principle, they could go away. 

Then (from previous step):
    dend#C180298A-P2_#axon-C190898A-P2_#_Scale_x1.000_y1.025_z1.000_#_Clone_11

would become: 
    dend#C180298A-P2#axon-C190898A-P2#Scale_x1.000_y1.025_z1.000#Clone_11

Forth, the fact that sections can be optional makes things more difficult. I would explicitely 
include them in the file name, leaving the 'data' part blank if necessary. 
For instance, this:
    dend-Fluo42_right_axon-Fluo42_right_-_Scale_x1.000_y1.050_z1.000

would become:
    dend#Fluo42_right#axon#Fluo42_right#Scale#x1.000_y1.050_z1.000#Clone#
    (notice there is nothing after 'Clone')

And finally, the fact that two sections can have the same value makes things more difficult too. 
I would repeat the value, in detriment of having a longer file name. 
For instance, this: 
    C080300B2_-_Scale_x1.000_y1.050_z1.000_-_Clone_21

would become: 
    dend#C080300B2#axon#C080300B2#Scale_x1.000_y1.050_z1.000#Clone_21
